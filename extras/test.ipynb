    "# MyTerminal - Custom Terminal Emulator\n",
    "\n",
    "MyTerminal is a lightweight graphical terminal application implemented with X11/Xlib, optionally accelerated by Pango/Cairo for robust UTF-8 rendering. It provides a shell-like environment supporting pipelines, redirections, history, tabs, background jobs, and a custom `multiWatch` command that executes multiple commands in parallel and streams their outputs with timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Functionality\n",
    "- **Graphical User Interface**: X11-based window with multiple tabs, each running an independent shell session.\n",
    "- **Command Execution**: Support for external commands, pipelines (`|`), and redirections (`<`, `>`, `2>`).\n",
    "- **Multiline Unicode Input**: Handles multiline input with unmatched quotes/backslashes and preserves Unicode encoding.\n",
    "- **Background Jobs**: Detach jobs with Ctrl+Z; list with `bgpids`; kill with `killprocess`. The `&` operator is not supported.\n",
    "- **Signal Handling**: Ctrl+C interrupts foreground jobs; proper process group management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Features\n",
    "- **multiWatch Command**: Executes multiple commands in parallel per period, streams outputs with UNIX timestamps and headers, using temp FIFOs per child PID. Cleans up on Ctrl+C and exit.\n",
    "- **Shell History**: Persistent history of up to 10,000 commands; `history` command; Ctrl+R for inline search (exact match or longest substring).\n",
    "- **Autocomplete**: Tab key for built-in commands, executables, and file paths. For files: single match completion, longest prefix for multiples, numbered selection prompt.\n",
    "- **Line Editing**: Basic input editing; Ctrl+A (start of line) and Ctrl+E (end of line).\n",
    "- **ANSI Rendering**: Colored output with optional Pango/Cairo for UTF-8 shaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operating System**: Linux with X11.\n",
    "- **Dependencies**:\n",
